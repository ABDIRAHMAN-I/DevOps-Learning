## Linux file system

Each directory in the Linux file system has a specific purpose, and together they help the system stay organized and efficient.

- **`/`**: The root of the file system.
- **`/home`**: Where user files are stored.
- **`/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/bin`**: Where executable programs are stored.
- **`/etc`**: Configuration files.
- **`/tmp`**: Temporary files.
- **`/var`**: Variable files like logs and caches.

- **`/lib`, `/usr/lib`**: Essential shared libraries and kernel modules.
- **`/boot`**: Contains boot loader files, including the kernel.
- **`/dev`**: Device files representing hardware devices.
- **`/proc`**: Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information.
- **`/sys`**: Virtual filesystem with information about the system and kernel.
- **`/mnt`**: Mount point for temporarily mounted filesystems.
- **`/media`**: Mount point for removable media like CDs and USB drives.
- **`/root`**: Home directory for the root user.
- **`/opt`**: Optional application software packages.
- **`/srv`**: Data for services provided by the system (e.g., web servers).
- **`/run`**: Runtime data (e.g., system information since the last boot).
