# What is Linux?

An open-source, operating system. It’s the backbone of many servers, networks, and cloud infrastructure.

(Linux is open source, which means that anyone can study, modify, and redistribute the source code. This is different from other operating systems, such as Windows and MacOS, which are proprietary)
